# Menu Management Service

# What does this do?
This is a command line program built to help companies manage and place orders. This program keeps track of everything on the menu, allows employees to add and subtract from the menu, and even
allows costumers to place orders. This program is meant to help small resturants keep track of their orders and their menus. 

# How to use
All you need to run this program is a C++ compiler. Once you have that, simply download the code and get started managing your menu. In your command line, in the file directory, simply run
"make" and all the files will compile and be ready to run.
